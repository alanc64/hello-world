Hey Folks,

It's time to learn and engage in something new. I'm not sure what I plan to take away from Github but when you have so many resources available at no cost, why not use them? 
As a logistician cursed with a curious mind, I love to see how everything works together and I'm bringing it with me to the software development field. I'm most comfortable with C derived languages but due to the workplace I've been dabbling in a little of everything in the stack.
